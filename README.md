Hello, so this is a fork of [Tokyo-Night](https://github.com/Dyzean/Tokyo-Night).
I found this theme very cool, but the light mod wasn't "light" enoght.


Also bc I am a bit cringe, I like font with ligature. 
If you no not like my font or do not whant to use it disable/edit it inside of the tokyo-night.theme.css.
The lignes after " /* Edit font for all */ ".
If it has stuff that's too hard to read or colors that you find more pleasing, make an issue or pool request I'll take a look.
